description: Work on the payment-fastapi async payment processor repository. Use when Codex needs to inspect, change, review, test, or document this FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL + RabbitMQ/FastStream service, especially around payment API behavior, transactional outbox publishing, idempotency, webhook delivery, retry queues, DLQ handling, Alembic migrations, Docker Compose, or task.pdf requirement alignment.

# Payment FastAPI

## Overview

Use this skill to keep changes aligned with the service contract: accept
payments through FastAPI, persist payment plus outbox atomically, publish
`payments.new`, process once in FastStream, send a webhook once, and retry or
dead-letter failures.

## Repo Map

- `app/api/routes.py`: payment endpoints and request header validation.
- `app/api/deps.py`: static `X-API-Key` dependency.
- `app/services/payments.py`: create/get payment logic and idempotency conflict
  behavior.
- `app/services/processor.py`: consumer workflow, gateway simulation,
  webhook-once guard, retry and DLQ publishing.
- `app/services/webhooks.py`: webhook payload construction and HTTP POST.
- `app/messaging/topology.py`: exchanges, queues, retry TTLs, routing keys.
- `app/messaging/outbox.py`: transactional outbox publisher loop.
- `app/models`: SQLAlchemy ORM models.
- `app/schemas`: Pydantic v2 API and message models.
- `alembic/versions`: database schema migrations.
- `tests`: unit and opt-in end-to-end coverage.

## Change Workflow

1. Read the relevant code path before editing. For requirement questions,
   compare against `task.pdf` first.
2. Preserve the core delivery guarantees unless the user explicitly changes
   them: outbox atomicity, intake idempotency, terminal-status idempotency,
   webhook-once delivery, retry queues, and DLQ.
3. Keep public API schemas separate from operational bookkeeping. Do not expose
   `webhook_sent_at`, `webhook_last_error`, or outbox columns by accident.
4. If a model column changes, update the ORM model, Alembic migration, schemas
   if applicable, and tests together.
5. Prefer deleting unused code over adding abstractions. Keep queue names and
   routing keys in `app/messaging/topology.py`.

## Behavior Contracts

- `POST /api/v1/payments` requires `X-API-Key` and `Idempotency-Key`, returns
  `202`, and creates an outbox event in the same transaction.
- Reusing the same idempotency key with the same body returns the original
  payment; reusing it with a different body returns `409`.
- The consumer locks the payment row, skips terminal statuses, simulates 2-5
  seconds of processing, and uses the configured success rate.
- `webhook_sent_at` is the duplicate-send guard. `webhook_last_error` records
  the last webhook failure and is cleared on success.
- Retry behavior is three total attempts: retry queue 1, retry queue 2, then
  `payments.dlq`.

## Verification Commands

Use targeted tests first:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/test_api_payments.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/test_outbox.py tests/test_topology.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/test_processor_processing.py tests/test_processor_retry.py tests/test_webhooks.py
```

Use broader checks before finalizing standard code changes:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q
ruff check .
docker compose config >/dev/null
```

Use `python3` for direct Python commands if `python` is unavailable. If plain
`pytest` cannot import `app`, retry with `PYTHONPATH=.` before diagnosing the
application.

## End-to-End Checks

Run these only when the Docker stack is available and the task needs real broker
or webhook proof:

```bash
E2E=1 pytest -q tests/test_e2e.py
E2E_BROKER_OUTAGE=1 pytest -q tests/test_broker_outage.py
```

Report skipped E2E coverage clearly when not run.
